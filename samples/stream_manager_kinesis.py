# Any data appended after the stream reaches the size limit, will continue to be appended, and
# StreamManager will delete the oldest data until the total stream size is back under 256MB.
# The Kinesis Data Stream in the cloud has no such bound, so all the data from this script
# will be uploaded to Kinesis and you will be charged for that usage.
